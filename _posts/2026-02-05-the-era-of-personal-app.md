excerpt: I built a custom Android app in 4 hours using AI. Why the future of software belongs to the "Market of One"—and how you can build your own.

## The Paper Habit

I am a software engineer by trade, which means I spend the vast majority of my waking hours typing code into a dark screen (though these days, I'm mostly talking to AI agents). Because of this, I often crave the opposite: the slow, deliberate friction of pen on paper. Writing things down manually forces me to think deeper, breaking the "auto-pilot" mode that high-speed typing often induces.

For about 18 months, I used a physical pocket notebook to track my non-essential purchases—things like clothes, shoes, games, or power tools that I didn't necessarily *need*, but definitely *wanted*. Like many, I am trying to fight the pull of consumerism. My system was specific: I didn't just want to track the price; I wanted to write down *why* I bought an item, and then return to that entry 3, 6, or 12 months later to conduct a "long-term review." This reflection helped me understand which purchases truly brought happiness and which were just dopamine-fueled impulse buys.

It was a noble experiment, but it eventually hit a wall.

## The "Market of One"

The problem with a physical notebook became apparent after a year. I had pages upon pages of text. When it came time to do my long-term reviews, finding the original entry was a pain—especially given my bad handwriting.

Then came the budget. I wanted to introduce a spending cap on top of the tracker. In a notebook, this meant calculating the remaining budget, writing it down in pencil, and then—when the next purchase happened—erasing it, re-calculating, and writing it again. It wasn't that the math was hard—I have a calculator for that—but the constant cycle of erasing and re-recording felt like a chore. The sheer friction of the process was becoming a bigger deterrent than the spending itself.

I looked for existing apps, but none of them fit. Most expense trackers are obsessed with charts, categories, and bank syncing. None of them were designed for my specific workflow: **Purchase -> Reflection -> Long-term Review**.

In the traditional software world, this is where the road ends. No tech company is going to build a "Mindful Consumerism Tracker with Long-term Review Features" because the entire market for it is effectively one person: **Me**.

*Of course, somewhere in the vast ocean of the App Store, a similar tool might exist. But the effort required to find it, test it, and then compromise on its features is often greater than the value it provides. When I say "Market of One," I’m referring to a tool that fits my specific brain, not just my general category.*

## The 4-Hour Build

This brings me to the core shift we are witnessing. In the past, bridging the gap between "what I need" and "what exists" required spending weeks coding it myself.

Instead, I decided to test the waters of **Agentic Programming**. I described my notebook system to an AI agent (a specialized chatbot that can write and run code). I explained the fields I needed, the logic for the budget deduction, and the searchability I lacked in paper form.

It took about 4 hours to go from that initial prompt to the AI providing me with an installable file (an APK for Android), and finally to a basic, functioning Android app on my phone.

I didn't need to set up a complex development environment. I didn't need to spend days designing a UI. I just needed the **idea**. This creates a fundamental democratization of software: You don't need coding knowledge to start building; you just need to know what problem you want to solve. And trust me, despite being a software engineer, I had no idea how to build a native Android app before this. I still don't, XD.

## The Death of the Translation Layer

As a professional developer, I know that the hardest part of building software isn't writing code—it is communication. In a traditional corporate environment, a domain expert (like a doctor, a teacher, or a supply chain manager) has a problem. They explain it to a Product Manager, who writes requirements. A designer interprets those into mockups. Finally, a developer writes the code.

At every hop in this chain, nuance is lost. The "soul" of the solution degrades. The developer doesn't feel the pain of the doctor; they just see a faceless support ticket. This is why so much enterprise software feels clunky and disconnected from the real work.

With AI, this translation layer evaporates. The person with the *pain* is now the person building the *cure*.

When I built my notebook app, I didn't have to write a specification document explaining why the "long-term review" field needed to be linked to the original purchase date. I didn't have to justify the feature to a roadmap committee. I simply told the agent what I needed. The feedback loop was instant. If the text input didn't feel right, I changed it. The distance between "thought" and "software" collapsed to zero.

## Living Software

The first version wasn't perfect, but that's the beauty of it. When I started using the app, I found friction points I hadn't anticipated. In a traditional app, I would have to file a feature request and hope the developers care enough to fix it in v2.0.

With my custom app, I just went back to the agent. I spent a few more hours refining the logic, tweaking the UI, and smoothing out the workflow. The app works like magic now because it was evolved specifically *by* me, *for* me.

This is the concept of **Disposable & Ephemeral Software**. The cost of building this was so low that if my needs change next year, I won't feel bad about deleting this app and building a new one. Software becomes as flexible as a spreadsheet but as powerful as a native application.

## Software for the Rest of Us

If we zoom out, this shift changes the economics of the entire software industry. For the last two decades, the software model has been driven by scale. To justify the high cost of engineering salaries, a product needed thousands or millions of users. This is why we have "One Size Fits All" platforms. We have Excel because everyone needs spreadsheets. We have Salesforce because every company needs CRM.

But what about the millions of unique human problems?
* The teacher who needs a specific way to track student participation based on the seating chart of the room.
* The community organizer who needs to coordinate volunteers based on their specific availability and vehicle type.
* Me, needing to track the emotional impact of consumerism over different long-term horizons.

Previously, these problems were "too small to code." They were left to messy spreadsheets or pen and paper. But the aggregate volume of these micro-problems is massive. AI brings the cost of software production down to near-zero, finally unlocking this massive potential. We are moving from a world of a few million apps that serve billions of people, to a world of billions of apps that serve... one person each.

## Conclusion

I admit, I have gone back to using computers rather than sticking with pen and paper. But the dynamic has changed. I am no longer forcing my life to fit into the rigid structures of mass-market software.

We have arrived at an era where the barrier to entry for creating software is crumbling. The cost of building a custom app that fits your exact purpose has decreased so sharply that individual customization is no longer a luxury—it's accessible to anyone with an idea RIGHT NOW.
